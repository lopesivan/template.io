The vision for gitignore.io is to become the authoritative source for .gitignore templates.  Right now gitignore provides templates for Operating Systems, IDEs and Programming Languages, but can eventually grow to encompass other creative spaces as well.

## Ways You Can Help

1. __Add Templates__ - Add more Programming Languages, Operating Systems and IDEs at [https://github.com/dvcs/gitignore](https://github.com/dvcs/gitignore)
2. __Explore__ -  Create better ways for users to interact with gitignore.io.
